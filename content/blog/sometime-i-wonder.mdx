I wonder, what life really is? Is it a grand cosmic accident or are we all dancing to an hidden rhythm without even realizing? This fragile thing we hold on to, does it mean something or rather anything? Is it in the happiness we experience, the pain we endure, or in these quiet spaces in between where we simply exist?

Why do we spend so much time chasing things like success, love, happiness, only to feel them slip through our fingers just when we think we’ve found them? Is it because we’re searching in the wrong places, or because the things we seek were never meant to be held, only felt?

I wonder why we, as humans, are so impossibly strange. Why do we carry dreams too big for our hearts and fears too small to make sense?  Why do we hurt each other, even though all we truly want is to be loved? We build walls to protect ourselves, but inside them, we feel lonelier than ever. We seek connection in a world full of distractions, only to find that the more we chase it, the farther it slips away? And still, we keep hoping, hoping that somehow, someone will break through the walls, and we’ll find the love we’ve been searching for all along.

And love, oh, how I wonder about love. Why is it both a balm and a wound? Why does it lift us so high, only to leave us crashing into ourselves? Is it because love asks us to be honest, to face the parts of us we’d rather hide? Or is it because we expect love to fix us when it was never meant to?

Sometimes, I really wonder why everything we desire always seems just out of reach.
Why does happiness feel like this brief, transient flickering moment that slips away no matter how hard we try to hold onto? Why does desolation or  sadness linger like a storm that never really passes? Maybe it's because life is a balance? a constant push and pull between joy and pain, hope and despair, meaning and chaos. Or maybe I’m just overthinking all of it. Honestly, I don't know. But it’s just another thing I wonder about.
